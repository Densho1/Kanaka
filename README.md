## Description
Kanaka is a single-player video game designed to help beginners learn the Japanese language. 

Players aim to catch specific kana falling from the top of their display by controlling a bucket which moves left-to-right. The specific kana they must catch, which changes over time, is announced only by sound/voice to promote listening skills.
 
The game ends when a player catches the wrong kana. After making a mistake, the player is given the correct answer in order to utilize the hypercorrection effect. 

The playerâ€™s goal is to play for as long as they possibly can.
